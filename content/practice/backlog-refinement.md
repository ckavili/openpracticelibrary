# What is It?

* Having a conversation to provide clarity surrounding the detail or conditions of satisfaction for work items in the backlog
* Identifying priority for work items in the backlog
* Sometimes called "Backlog Grooming"

# Why use it?

* Drive team shared understanding of work items in regards to:
  * Scope of work in the backlog
  * Conditions of satisfaction
  * Prioritization of what to do first

## How often should it occur and for how long?

* The simple answer is as often as is necessary
* Typically its advised that 1 hour of refinement should suffice for each week of the sprint 

## Advice

* Although typically occurring as a team meeting, backlog refinement can occur throughout the sprint with the required parties. However information gained in this meeting must be adequately radiated to those who need it.
* Product owners are also not necessarily required for a backlog refinement. The key is to have those who have sufficient knowledge to talk through a backlog item and answer questions. This may come in the form of a Product owner, Stakeholder, Developer etc
