## What is it?

This is a simple way for evaluating the forces pro and con that are at play with regards to certain change. Typically, this is a change the organization is interested in or faces. 

This is a method coming from the field of Social Science and developed by Kurt Lewin.

Dave Gray has introduced a map (Force Field Map), which provides an excellent canvas for having a conversation with all participants in front of a flipchart or whiteboard.

## Why use it?

* Change cannot be managed. It can only be facilitated. To facilitate something one has to build sufficient understanding of it
* Organizational systems are complex systems and require system thinking for their understanding. Force field analysis is a way to open the door to systems thinking in situations where organisations are going through change
* Provides a good understanding of the environment, which in turn could allow for Lean Change Management practices to be used for facilitating the change process
