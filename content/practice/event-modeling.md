This practice is related to: [Domain Driven Design](https://openpracticelibrary.com/perspective/domain-driven-design/).

## What is it?

> Event Modeling is a way to design a blueprint for an Information System of any size or scale. It is done in a way that allows the clearest communication of the system's workings to the largest possible cross-section of roles in an organization. The system can be checked for completeness by following the single thread of data propagation through it.

\- From [eventmodeling.org](https://eventmodeling.org/)

## Why use it?

To help better understand and model an information system with clarity for all (linking UX/UI all the way through to persistance) through a visual representation.
